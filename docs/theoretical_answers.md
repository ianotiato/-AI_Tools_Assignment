# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

## Q1: TensorFlow vs PyTorch Differences

**TensorFlow:**

- Developed by Google Brain
- Static computation graph (though eager execution now available)
- Strong production deployment capabilities
- Comprehensive ecosystem (TFX, TensorBoard, etc.)
- Better for large-scale deployments

**PyTorch:**

- Developed by Facebook's AI Research lab
- Dynamic computation graph (more Pythonic)
- Easier debugging and prototyping
- Preferred for research and academia
- More intuitive for Python developers

**When to choose:**

- TensorFlow: Production systems, mobile deployment, enterprise applications
- PyTorch: Research, rapid prototyping, academic projects

## Q2: Jupyter Notebooks Use Cases

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Interactive data exploration and visualization
2. **Model Prototyping:** Quick experimentation with different architectures and parameters

## Q3: spaCy vs Basic String Operations

spaCy provides:

- Pre-trained models for various languages
- Efficient tokenization and parsing
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Dependency parsing
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Word vectors and similarity detection
- Compared to basic string operations: More accurate, handles context, and provides linguistic features
